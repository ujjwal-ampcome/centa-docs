This system provides a centralized platform where educators, subject matter experts, and administrators can collaborate efficiently and effectively. It streamlines the workflow involved in question creation, review, approval, and the assembly of those questions into exam papers.

These questions can be categorized based on subject, topic, difficulty level, or any other relevant criteria. The question bank serves as a repository for educators to access and reuse questions when creating exams.

These tools often support rich formatting options, including mathematical equations, diagrams, images, and multimedia elements.
